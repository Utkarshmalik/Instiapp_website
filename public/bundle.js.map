A push notification will be send to all parents\\\n           when there child reaches and leaves the school.'\n}];\nvar RowCard = function RowCard(_ref) {\n  var pic = _ref.pic,\n      text = _ref.text;\n  return _react2.default.createElement(\n    'section',\n    { className: 'row gps-row-card__wrapper' },\n    _react2.default.createElement(\n      'div',\n      { className: 'column small-12 large-4' },\n      _react2.default.createElement(\n        'figure',\n        null,\n        _react2.default.createElement('img', { src: pic, className: 'gps-row-card__image' })\n      )\n    ),\n    _react2.default.createElement(\n      'div',\n      { className: 'column small-12 large-expanded text-justify notice-row-card__content' },\n      text\n    )\n  );\n};\nvar TransportPage = function TransportPage() {\n  return _react2.default.createElement(\n    'main',\n    { className: 'page page-gps' },\n    _react2.default.createElement(_Header2.default, null),\n    _react2.default.createElement(\n      'section',\n      null,\n      _react2.default.createElement(\n        'article',\n        null,\n        _react2.default.createElement(\n          'header',\n          { className: 'section-gps-header' },\n          _react2.default.createElement(_PageHeading2.default, {\n            text1: 'GPS ',\n            text2: 'Bus ',\n            text3: 'Tracking',\n            classes: ' heading_theme_white'\n          })\n        ),\n        _react2.default.createElement(\n          'section',\n          null,\n          _react2.default.createElement(\n            'article',\n            { className: 'row align-spaced section__content' },\n            _data2.default.map(function (item, index) {\n              return _react2.default.createElement(_NoticeComponent2.default, _extends({ key: index }, item));\n            })\n          ),\n          _react2.default.createElement(\n            'article',\n            null,\n            _react2.default.createElement(\n              'figure',\n              null,\n              _react2.default.createElement('img', { src: './public/images/transport.png', className: 'section-gps__image' })\n            )\n          ),\n          _react2.default.createElement(\n            'article',\n            { className: 'section-gps__background-color' },\n            _react2.default.createElement(\n              'header',\n              null,\n              _react2.default.createElement(_SectionHeading2.default, {\n                text1: 'GPS ',\n                text2: 'Bus ',\n                text3: 'Tracking'\n              })\n            ),\n            _react2.default.createElement(RowCard, rowData[0])\n          )\n        )\n      )\n    ),\n    _react2.default.createElement(_Footer2.default, null)\n  );\n};\nexports.default = TransportPage;\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 118 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n// style-loader: Adds some css to the DOM by adding a <style> tag\n\n// load the styles\nvar content = __webpack_require__(264);\nif(typeof content === 'string') content = [[module.i, content, '']];\n// add the styles to the DOM\nvar update = __webpack_require__(266)(content, {\"useable\":true});\nif(content.locals) module.exports = content.locals;\n// Hot Module Replacement\nif(false) {\n\t// When the styles change, update the <style> tags\n\tif(!content.locals) {\n\t\tmodule.hot.accept(\"!!../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--1-1!../node_modules/postcss-loader/lib/index.js??ref--1-2!./main.css\", function() {\n\t\t\tvar newContent = require(\"!!../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--1-1!../node_modules/postcss-loader/lib/index.js??ref--1-2!./main.css\");\n\t\t\tif(typeof newContent === 'string') newContent = [[module.id, newContent, '']];\n\t\t\tupdate(newContent);\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\t// When the module is disposed, remove the <style> tags\n\tmodule.hot.dispose(function() { update(); });\n}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 119 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\n/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n *\n */\n\n\n\nvar _typeof = typeof Symbol === \"function\" && typeof Symbol.iterator === \"symbol\" ?
